# Changelog

## 1.1.1 (2026-03-13)

### Fixed
- Simplified `git remote` shell embedding in `explore-plan` and `tdd` commands to avoid `bwrap` sandbox errors (removed piped `sed` commands)

## 1.1.0 (2026-03-11)

### Added
- `backend-explorer` agent: Dedicated agent for backend/API layer exploration (models, views, serializers, endpoints)
- `frontend-explorer` agent: Dedicated agent for frontend/UI layer exploration (components, hooks, routing, state)
- `test-explorer` agent: Dedicated agent for test suite exploration (frameworks, fixtures, patterns, coverage)
- `history-explorer` agent: Dedicated agent for git history and open PR exploration (conflicts, patterns)
- `tdd-patterns` skill: Institutional knowledge for TDD workflows (iteration limits, coverage gates, phase constraints)
- Stop hooks on `explore-plan` and `tdd` commands for next-step guidance

### Changed
- `explore-plan` command now spawns named agents instead of inline Explore subagents
- `tdd` command now references `tdd-patterns` skill for consistent TDD constraints

## 1.0.0 (2026-03-11)

### Added
- `tdd` command: Test-driven feature development with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle and coverage gates
- `explore-plan` command: Parallel 4-agent codebase exploration with synthesized implementation plan
